# Job.map()

Job applications organizer - Job.map() is a tool to keep track of job applications sent by a user. The app allows to specify a company to which a logged in user applies to, a point of contact from a given company, a techstack required for the position, and a role (Backend, Frontend, or Full-stack). Each application supports adding notes to save important information. As the user progresses with an application, the current stage of it can be changed to reflect a specific interview user is going through now or even a job offer. In case a user has applied for multiple positions, the search page can help to find a desired application by a company name. The project was created with the React.JS for the frontend, and Express.JS + PostgreSQL for the backend.
